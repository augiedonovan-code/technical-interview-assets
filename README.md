# Data Visualization Case Study — Netflix Content Catalog

## Objective
This case study evaluates your ability to:
- Explore an unfamiliar dataset independently
- Identify meaningful patterns and trends
- Create clear, aesthetically pleasing visualizations
- Communicate insights to a senior executive audience
- Translate analysis into directional strategic recommendations

---

## Dataset Overview
You will use the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows** dataset provided in this repository.

Each row represents **one Netflix title** (movie or TV show) and includes metadata such as:
- Content type (Movie or TV Show)
- Release year
- Date added to Netflix
- Country of production
- Genre classifications
- Content rating
- Duration

> **Note:** This dataset contains catalog metadata only. It does **not** include viewership, revenue, or engagement metrics. Recommendations should be framed accordingly.

---

## Tools
- **Tableau Public** (required)  
  https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download

You may use other tools (SQL, Python, Excel) for data preparation, but all final visualizations must be created in Tableau Public.

## Case Study Prompt
You are an analyst asked to help Netflix leadership better understand the **composition and evolution of the content catalog**.

Using the dataset:

1. Create a Tableau dashboard or story that highlights the most important trends and patterns.
2. Identify **3–5 key insights** that would be meaningful to senior executives.
3. Provide **diagnostic commentary** explaining *why* these patterns may exist.
4. Based on your findings, propose **1–2 strategic recommendations** related to:
   - Content mix and balance
   - Genre or format concentration
   - Geographic representation
   - Areas of potential over- or under-investment

There is no single correct answer. Focus on clarity, reasoning, and communication.

### 1. Tableau Public Workbook
- One or more dashboards or a Tableau Story
- Clear visual hierarchy and layout
- Appropriate chart selection
- Thoughtful use of color, labels, and annotations

### 2. Written Summary (1–2 pages)
Include:
- **3–5 executive-level insights**
- Brief diagnostic explanation for each insight
- **1–2 strategic recommendations**

## Guidance on Insights
Strong insights typically:
- Go beyond simple counts or rankings
- Combine multiple dimensions (time, geography, genre, format)
- Highlight trends, shifts, or concentration
- Clearly answer *“So what?”* for leadership

Examples (illustrative only):
- Shifts in the mix of movies vs TV shows over time
- Concentration of content by country or region
- Genre saturation or gaps in the catalog
- Changes in content age relative to catalog growth

---

## Strategic Recommendations
Recommendations should:
- Be grounded in observed patterns
- Be realistic and clearly articulated
- Acknowledge data limitations
- Focus on **direction**, not execution detail

---

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
- Analytical reasoning and curiosity
- Visual clarity and design quality
- Strength and relevance of insights
- Executive-level communication
- Quality of recommendations
- Transparency around assumptions and limitations

---

## Notes
- The dataset includes known limitations (missing values, multi-valued fields).
- How you handle or acknowledge these limitations is part of the evaluation.
- Perfection is not expected — thoughtfulness and clarity are.
